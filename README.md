# EcoShare
EcoShare connects communities by letting people share surplus food, clothes, books &amp; stationery in real time—reducing waste, promoting responsible consumption, and making sharing simple.
# Problem Statement and Solution
In daily life, many usable resources such as food, clothes, books, and stationery are wasted, while people in nearby communities struggle to access the same essentials. This gap exists due to the absence of a simple and unified sharing platform, as current solutions are either limited to specific use cases or are not accessible to common users. As a result, valuable resources remain unused and are eventually discarded. EcoShare is a web-based platform designed to bridge this gap by allowing users to post surplus resources and enabling nearby users to discover and claim them in real time. By promoting community-level sharing, EcoShare encourages responsible consumption and significantly reduces everyday waste.
